# Multi-Car Racing Simulation

Welcome to the Multi-Car Racing Simulation repository! This project contains simulations for single and multi-agent environments in car racing without pit stops. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Clone the Repository

First, ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/). After installation, run the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:

git clone [URL_of_Your_Repository] cd multi_car_racing

## Installation

Before running the simulations, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Ensure that you have Anaconda installed to manage your packages and environments. You can download it from [Anaconda's official site](https://www.anaconda.com/).

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the repository directory and run the following commands:

conda env create -f conda_explicit.txt pip install -r pip_frozen.txt

## Running the Simulations
